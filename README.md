# Fake News Finder

![Project Logo](Borowitz-Trump.gif)

This is my semester final project for Building IT Systems in my 1st year of a Bachelor's Degree in IT. The assignment focused predominately on back-end functionality, therefore, the GUI is very simple. This program uses HTML scraping to extract the most recent headlines from 3 specific online news agencies: Forbes, Ars Technica and The Atlantic. It offers the latest details on the headline story, a brief excerpt from the story, as well as the date-time of publishing. Additionally, you can follow the links offered to be directed to the article webpage to view the full details of the article. Once the user has read the article, they are free to use the truth scale in order to rate the 'truthfulness' of the specific article. This rating is then saved in an SQLite Database.
